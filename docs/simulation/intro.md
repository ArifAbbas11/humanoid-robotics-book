# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Simulation is critical for developing and testing robot behaviors without requiring physical hardware. This module covers building and simulating humanoid robots in physics environments like Gazebo and Unity, integrating various sensors for realistic interaction.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Install and configure Gazebo and Unity simulation environments
- Build humanoid robot models with realistic physics properties
- Integrate virtual sensors (LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU) in simulations
- Configure sensor outputs for ROS 2 integration
- Test robot behaviors in simulated environments with realistic physics

## Prerequisites

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Ubuntu 22.04 or equivalent Linux distribution

## Module Structure

1. [Gazebo Setup](gazebo-setup.md) - Installing and configuring Gazebo
2. [Unity Setup](unity-setup.md) - Setting up Unity for robotics simulation
3. [Physics Concepts](physics-concepts.md) - Understanding simulation physics
4. [Sensor Integration](sensors.md) - Adding sensors to robot models
5. [Sensor Configuration](sensor-configuration.md) - Configuring sensor outputs
6. [Mini-Project](mini-project.md) - Building a complete humanoid simulation
7. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) - Common simulation issues

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, you should be able to launch a simulated humanoid robot in Gazebo/Unity with functional sensors and observe realistic physics interactions.
