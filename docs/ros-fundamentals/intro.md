# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the middleware for robot control, providing a framework for distributed computing across multiple processes and devices. In this module, we'll explore the core concepts of ROS 2 and how to set up a basic robotic control system using Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Install and configure ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill)
- Create ROS 2 packages with nodes, publishers, and subscribers
- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Integrate Python with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Create basic URDF models for robots

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 or equivalent Linux distribution
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful)

## Module Structure

1. [Installation Guide](installation.md) - Setting up ROS 2 on your system
2. [Architecture Concepts](architecture.md) - Understanding ROS 2's design
3. [Nodes, Topics, Services](nodes-topics-services.md) - Core communication mechanisms
4. [Python Integration](python-integration.md) - Using rclpy for Python development
5. [URDF Basics](urdf-basics.md) - Creating robot models
6. [Mini-Project](mini-project.md) - Building a complete ROS 2 package
7. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and solutions

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, you should be able to successfully install ROS 2, create a basic ROS 2 package, and control a simulated robot with a simple Python script, demonstrating understanding of nodes, topics, and services.
