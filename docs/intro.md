# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Simulation to Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book will take you from the fundamentals of ROS 2 through advanced topics in simulation, AI navigation, and Vision-Language-Action integration.

## Book Structure

The book is organized into four main modules plus a capstone project:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- ROS 2 architecture and fundamentals
- Nodes, Topics, Services
- Python integration with rclpy
- URDF basics

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
- Physics simulation and environment building
- Sensor integration (LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU)
- Visualization in Unity

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- VSLAM, navigation, and path planning
- Advanced perception pipelines

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
- Voice-to-Action integration with Whisper
- Cognitive planning with LLMs
- Multi-modal interaction

### Capstone Project
- End-to-end workflow: perception → planning → action
- Integration of all modules
- Complete humanoid robot implementation

## Target Audience

This book is designed for students, researchers, and hobbyists interested in embodied AI, robotics, and AI-human interaction. We assume basic programming knowledge and gradually build up to advanced concepts.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
