# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module represents the cutting edge of embodied AI, enabling intuitive human-robot interaction and cognitive reasoning for complex tasks. This module covers integrating large language models (LLMs) with robotics to enable humanoid robots to understand and respond to voice commands for autonomous task execution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up voice recognition using Whisper for command processing
- Integrate LLMs for cognitive planning and decision making
- Create multi-modal interaction systems (vision, language, action)
- Build voice-to-action pipelines for robot control
- Implement cognitive planning for complex task execution

## Prerequisites

- Completed Modules 1, 2, and 3
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Access to computing resources for LLM inference
- Basic knowledge of cognitive architectures

## Module Structure

1. [Voice Recognition](voice-recognition.md) - Setting up Whisper for speech-to-text
2. [LLM Integration](llm-integration.md) - Connecting LLMs for planning
3. [Cognitive Planning](cognitive-planning.md) - Creating planning architectures
4. [Multi-Modal Interaction](multi-modal.md) - Integrating multiple sensors
5. [Voice-to-Action Pipeline](voice-to-action.md) - Complete pipeline implementation
6. [Capstone Project](capstone-project.md) - Integrating all VLA capabilities
7. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) - Common VLA integration issues

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, you should be able to demonstrate a humanoid robot receiving a voice command (e.g., "pick up the red ball"), processing it through an LLM for cognitive planning, navigating to the object, and performing the manipulation task.
