# Capstone Project: Complete Humanoid Robot Implementation

## Overview

The capstone project integrates all modules into a complete end-to-end system, demonstrating the full spectrum of humanoid robotics capabilities from perception to action. This project combines ROS 2 control, simulation, AI navigation, and Vision-Language-Action integration.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this capstone project, you will be able to:
- Integrate all four modules into a cohesive system
- Implement an end-to-end perception → planning → action workflow
- Deploy a complete humanoid robot solution in simulation
- Troubleshoot complex multi-module integration issues
- Validate the complete system against specified requirements

## Prerequisites

- Completion of all four modules (ROS 2, Simulation, AI Navigation, VLA)
- Understanding of system integration principles
- Debugging and validation skills across multiple technologies

## Project Structure

1. [System Architecture](integration-guide.md) - Complete system design
2. [End-to-End Workflow](integration-guide.md) - Complete implementation guide
3. [Testing Guide](testing-guide.md) - Validation and testing procedures
4. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) - Complex integration issues

## Success Criteria

After completing this capstone project, you should be able to demonstrate a complete system where a humanoid robot receives voice commands, processes them through LLM, plans navigation, and executes manipulation tasks in a simulated environment.
