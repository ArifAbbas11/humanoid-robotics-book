# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

This module focuses on advanced perception and navigation pipelines for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac, leveraging VSLAM and path planning capabilities. We'll explore how to create intelligent robot behaviors that can map unknown environments and navigate autonomously.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Install and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS
- Implement VSLAM for environment mapping and localization
- Create navigation and path planning pipelines
- Develop obstacle avoidance systems
- Integrate perception and navigation with ROS 2

## Prerequisites

- Completed Modules 1 and 2
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- Understanding of computer vision concepts
- Basic knowledge of path planning algorithms

## Module Structure

1. [Isaac Setup](isaac-setup.md) - Installing NVIDIA Isaac tools
2. [Isaac Sim Configuration](isaac-sim.md) - Setting up simulation environment
3. [Isaac ROS Integration](isaac-ros.md) - Connecting Isaac with ROS 2
4. [VSLAM Implementation](vslam.md) - Visual SLAM for mapping and localization
5. [Navigation Planning](navigation-planning.md) - Path planning and execution
6. [Mini-Project](mini-project.md) - Complete perception and navigation pipeline
7. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) - Common AI navigation issues

## Success Criteria

After completing this module, you should be able to implement a perception and navigation pipeline that allows a simulated robot in Isaac Sim to map an unknown environment, localize itself, and navigate to a target destination autonomously while avoiding obstacles.
