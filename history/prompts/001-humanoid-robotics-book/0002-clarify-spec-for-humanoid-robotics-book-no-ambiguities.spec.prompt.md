## Prompt

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response snapshot

No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification. The specification is comprehensive and well-defined.\n\n[Coverage Summary Table]\n\nI recommend proceeding to `/sp.plan` to begin architectural design.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The feature specification was thoroughly scanned for ambiguities, and none were found that required formal clarification at this stage.
- 🧪 Tests: The ambiguity scan determined the spec to be clear.
- 📁 Files: No modifications were made to the spec file during this clarification, as no ambiguities were found.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The specification is ready for the `/sp.plan` command.
- 🧠 Reflection: The initial `/sp.specify` command produced a high-quality specification that required no further clarification, demonstrating a solid understanding of the project requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable.
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Not applicable.
